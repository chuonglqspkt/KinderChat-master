================
= To add a new controller:
================

um.. just add here a class inherited from BaseController. That's all.
declare any _registered_ dependencies in the constructor - it will be instantiated by AutoFac anyway


================
= To add a new API method to any controller:
================

1) add a method with the following signature:

[ApiMethod]
(void or XXXResponse) XXX(ISession session, XXXRequest request) //void return type is for unimportant requests like "Is typing.."

XXXResponse and XXXRequest should be created in KinderChat.ServerClient.Entities.Ws.Requests (KinderChat.ServerClient assembly). you can use a code snippet "prr" for it.

2) don't forget to regenerate PROXY classes (KinderChat.ServerClient.Ws.Proxy) on your clients (T4?)
